# serelix-boot (srlxboot)

srlxboot is a tiny bootloader for UEFI machines.

## Goals

From a broader view it's a part of a bigger OS development project called
Serelix (SE-cure, REL-iable un-IX).

Features:
* Linux support (done for EFI stub kernels)
* of course, support for my own kernel (todo)
* a simple config format (done, see boot.cfg)
* plugins?

## Building

Run 'make MDE=/path/to/MdePkg'

## Why?

> Just for fun.
