# serelix-boot (srlxboot)

srlxboot is a (yet) unfinished bootloader that aims to be simple and flexible.

## Goals

From a broader view it's a part of a bigger OS development project called
Serelix (SE-cure, REL-iable un-IX).

Planned features:
* Linux support
* of course, support for my own kernel
* a simple config format
* plugins?

## Why?

> Just for fun.
